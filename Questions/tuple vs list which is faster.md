 # Which one is faster

 Tuple and List are two data structures in Python that can store data. Both data structures store data in a specific order of any type (e.g. integers or strings).

## When each is used:
A tuple should be used whenever the user is aware of what is inserted in the tuple. Suppose that a college stores the information of its students in a data structure; in order for this information to remain immutable it should be stored in a tuple.

Since lists provide users with easier accessibility, they should be used whenever similar types of objects need to be stored. For instance, if a grocery needs to store all the dairy products in one field, it should use a list.
